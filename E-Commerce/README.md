# 🧠 SQL Data Analysis Portfolio Project

This project demonstrates the use of **SQL** for exploring, aggregating, and deriving insights from structured data. It includes a collection of queries ranging from basic data selection to advanced techniques like **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** and **window functions**.

## 📂 File Included

- `SQL.sql`: A script containing all queries used in the analysis

## 📌 Topics Covered

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Handling NULLs, duplicates, formatting
- 🔍 **Exploratory Analysis**: Identifying key trends in the dataset
- 🧾 **Aggregations**: Grouping data by time, category, or region
- 📐 **Joins**: Merging multiple tables to enrich analysis
- 🧮 **CTEs and Window Functions**:
  - Ranking and row numbering
  - Running totals and averages
  - Conditional logic in queries

## 🎯 Project Objective

To showcase strong SQL skills using realistic business datasets and queries that can be applied in:
- E-commerce data analysis
- Sales and revenue breakdowns
- Customer segmentation
- Operational metrics

## 🔧 Tools Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite syntax compatible)
- Optional use within a DB tool like DB Browser for SQLite, DBeaver, or PostgreSQL clients

## 💼 Portfolio Value

This project was designed to highlight the ability to:
- Write clean, modular, and reusable SQL queries
- Analyze datasets from multiple angles
- Work with both simple and complex query patterns
