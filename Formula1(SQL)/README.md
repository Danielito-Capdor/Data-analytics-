# 🏎️ Formula 1 Data Analysis with SQL

This project explores Formula 1 racing data using structured SQL queries. It highlights how powerful insights can be drawn from motorsport datasets using SQL, including performance metrics, race outcomes, driver stats, and constructor comparisons.

## 📂 File Included

- `formula1_analysis_queries.sql`: SQL file containing all queries used in the project

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze Formula 1 race results across seasons
- Extract driver and constructor performance insights
- Use advanced SQL techniques like CTEs and window functions

## 🧠 Key Analysis Topics

- 🏁 **Race Results**: Fastest laps, podium finishes, race wins
- 👨‍✈️ **Driver Performance**: Win percentages, consistency metrics
- 🏢 **Team & Constructor Analysis**: Yearly rankings and comparisons
- 📅 **Season Trends**: Most competitive seasons, points evolution
- 🔍 **Advanced SQL**:
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.)
  - Aggregations & Filtering
  - Joins across multiple tables

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- SQL (compatible with PostgreSQL / SQLite)
- Data sourced from open Formula 1 datasets or relational database

## 💼 Portfolio Value

This project demonstrates:
- Complex query writing
- Domain-specific data modeling
- Translating raw motorsport data into clear, visualizable insights
